// Use constructor functions and prototypes to create a webpage where a user can create a single bank account with an initial deposit amount. Then allow the user to make withdrawals, deposits and see the balance of the account.
//
// Remember to create a BankAccount constructor and a prototype that includes methods for deposit and withdrawal and any other properties needed. Here is an example wireframe to help you visualize the app:

//business logic

// user interface logic
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#form").submit(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

  });
});
